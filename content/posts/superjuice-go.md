### recipe websites suck
every recipe website hates you and doesn't respect your time. using them is one of the most infuriating experiences, every single time. there, i said it

### superjuice
superjuice is a way to get up to 8x more juice out of citrus for making cocktails or cooking. by combining the peels of the fruit and a few simple ingredients, you can 
- get more juice
- extend the shelf life of the juice
- save money
- reduce waste

why the hell not? if you want to learn more, the wonderful folks at Very Good Drinks have a write up [here](https://verygooddrinks.co/ultimate-super-juice-guide/)

### superjuice go
this is simple recipe calculator that aims to not suck. just put in the kind of citrus you have and the weight of the peels and it'll give you the proportions for the rest of the ingredients. that's it. 

i really just wanted a good excuse to play with [HTMX](https://htmx.org/) and [Go](https://golang.org/) ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
